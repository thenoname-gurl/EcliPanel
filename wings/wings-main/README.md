# Calagopus Wings

a rewrite of [pterodactyl wings](https://github.com/pterodactyl/wings) in the rust programming language. this rewrite aims to be 100% API compatible while implementing new features and better performance.

[todo](https://notes.rjns.dev/workspace/cb7ccae8-0508-4f90-9161-d1e69b0ca8f0/uAVAL7iHSQpDk1SiSUPL1)

## quick installation

### please remember to update atleast weekly

```bash
sudo curl -L "https://github.com/calagopus/wings/releases/latest/download/wings-rs-$(uname -m)-linux" -o /usr/local/bin/wings
sudo chmod +x /usr/local/bin/wings

wings version
```
